## Introduction
Spark comes with several project types. This gives you the flexibility to use whatever ASP.NET project type you'd like while also taking advantage of all the functionality Spark provides.

### Blazor
The Blazor project type sets up a Blazor Server project for you.

Blazor projects utilize Razor components to split your markdown into re-usable chunks. These components also have the ability to contain logic specific to themselves.

To create a Spark Blazor project, simply run the following command.
```bash
spark new MyAppName -t blazor
```

You can read more about it in our docs [here](/docs/blazor).

### MVC
The MVC project type sets up a ASP.NET MVC project for you.

MVC projects follow the conventional Model-View-Controller architecture. For it's frontend, it uses the Razor templating engine and server side generation.

To create a Spark MVC project, simply run the following command.
```bash
spark new MyAppName -t mvc
```
