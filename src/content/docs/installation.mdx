## Requirements
Before creating your first spark project, you should ensure that your local machine has:

- **.NET 7 installed** You can find the download [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).

You will also need **Entity Framework Core tools**. This can be installed with a simple `dotnet` command in your terminal:
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

## Your First Spark Project
After you have installed the required dependencies, you will need to install the Spark console tool.
```bash
dotnet tool install --global Spark.CLI
spark install
```

You are now ready to create your first Spark project!
```bash
spark new MyApp -t blazor
```

>
> Spark comes with several project types. You can choose to generate your project with a certain type by providing the `-t` option.
> 
> Blazor
> Example: `spark new MyApp`
>
> Mvc
> Example: `spark new MyApp -t mvc`
>
> Razor
> Example: `spark new MyApp -t razor`
>
> To see all the project type options, check out our documentation [here](/docs/project-types)
>

>
> Spark projects come setup with Tailwind CSS. You can choose a different CSS framework by providing the `--css` option.
> 
> Example: `spark new MyApp --css bootstrap`
>
> To see all the CSS options, check out our documentation [here](/docs/frontend#css-framework-options)
>

After the project has been created, you can create and run the migrations for the user tables.
```bash
cd MyApp
spark make migration User
spark migrate
```

You can open your Spark project in Visual Studio from the console by using Spark's `open` command.
```bash
spark open
```

Finally, start .NET's local development server using the dotnet watch command:
```bash
dotnet watch
```

## Updating Spark CLI
The easiest way to update the Spark CLI is to uninstall and reinstall it.
```bash
dotnet tool uninstall -g Spark.CLI
dotnet tool install -g Spark.CLI
```

## Updating the Spark Project Template
To update the Spark project template, simply run the spark update command in your console.
```bash
spark update
```
